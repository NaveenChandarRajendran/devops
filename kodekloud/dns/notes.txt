The system A and B connected same network

we can mention the ip address of B and call.
Also we can give the host name for our readability.

But doing like that the issue is for one IP address we can have lot of namee
ex:
312:313:231 db
312:313:231 www.google.com

ssh db will trigger the same host and
ssh www.google.com will trigger same host.

image we have lot of ip address means and it changed means we want to change it here also in many places.

To manage the ip address everything we will have a centralized network called dns


ex:
199:232:21:213
