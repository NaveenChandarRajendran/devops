RPM - Red Hat Package Manager
-----------------------------------

Install Package
    ->rpm -i telnet.rpm

Uninstall Package
    ->rpm -e telnet

Details/Query about Package
    -> rpm -q telnet

the rpm is straight forward install but it does not install the dependcy Package
ex:
    if you want to installl ansible just rpm - i ansible will install only the anisble.
    But to run ansible it need python and other dependent package. 
    To overcome this we will use YUM- package Managerss

-----------------------------------
YUM
-----------------------------------
yum install ansible

It will download the nessecary packages.

The yum already have the some important repos in local system.It will check here 1st if not present

yum list ansible

yum remove ansible
to remove the package

yum --showduplicates lisst ansible
it will show the duplicate ansible package with different versions.

to install the particular version ansible
yum install ansible-2.4.2.0
