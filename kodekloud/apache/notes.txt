In Config the httpd can serve one or more applications
Ex:

in the config file,we need to mention the <VirtualHost> for both the application

Ex:
in Config file 
<VirtualHost *:80>
    Servarname www.house.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/houses
</VirtualHost/>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    Servarname www.oranges.com
