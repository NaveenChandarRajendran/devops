----------
switch
----------
    -> Computer a and b  both will connected with switch.
    -> that switch will create the netwrok
    -> once we add the IP address for both the devices a and b
    -> connection will be established

----------
routing
----------
    -> IF A and b are connected with one netwrok by switch and C and D are connected with one network.
    -> What if b and c needs to be connect.
    -> In that case router will come. The router will connect the two networks.
    -> In simple think router as service with multiple network ports.
    -> The router will take one ip from each network
    -> IF B send data to C means where the router is present in th enetwork.Because more netwrok will be preent.
    -> In that case Gateway will be usefull

----------
Gateway
----------
    It is the door to the router to connect to other networks
